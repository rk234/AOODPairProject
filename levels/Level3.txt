First, get into orbit around Earth like in the last level. Then,
once you are on the opposite side of the Earth to Planet-B, rotate
the rocket to point in the direction of its motion and accelrate until
your forecasted track enters Planet-B's radius of influence (this may
take multiple attempts until you get it right). Wait until the rocket
enters Planet-B's radius of influence and then rotate the rocket to 
point in the opposite direction of its motion. Hold the space bar until
you see an orbit form around Planet-B.
