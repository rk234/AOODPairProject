First, get into orbit around Earth like in the last level. Then,
once you are on the opposite side of the Earth to the Moon, rotate
the rocket to point in the direction of its motion and accelrate until
your forecasted track enters the Moon's radius of influence (this may
take multiple attempts until you get it right). Wait until the rocket
enters the Moon's radius of influence and then rotate the rocket to 
point in the opposite direction of its motion. Hold the space bar until
you see an orbit form around the moon.
