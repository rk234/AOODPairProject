Like the last level, first get into orbit around Planet-B. Then,
rotate the rocket to point in the opposite direction of its motion
and accelerate until the rocket is forecasted to impact the surface
of Planet-B. As you approach the surface, make sure to reduce your
speed to a safe magnitude before landing.
