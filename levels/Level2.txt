To reach orbit, you need to gain both altitude and tangential velocity.
The best way to do this is by pressing space while occasionally rotating
the rocket to the right. You should begin to see a parabolic trajectory
forming. Once the highest point in the rocket's trajectory is above
the minimum orbit altitude, stop accelerating and wait until the rocket
reaches the apex of its trajectory. Then, rotate the rocket so that it is
pointing tangent to the planet and accelerate until you the minimum point
of your orbit rises above the minimum orbit altitude.
